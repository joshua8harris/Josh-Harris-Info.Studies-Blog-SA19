  Analyzing the content for the week provided new and valuable information. To think the world we live in today is entirely different than that of just a century ago is fascinating to me. The way we communicate, share and interpret information, and view the world in general has all stemmed from different technological advancements. From the creation of the telegraph and electricity to wireless telephones and internet, every facet of our lives is influenced, which is something we do not immediately recognize. Religion, culture, ideology are all influenced by these things.
  The first of this week's readings was “Technology and Ideology: The Case of the Telegraph,” by James W. Carey. In this reading Carey’s main purpose was to inform the reader of the history of the telegraph’s creation and how it played a role in the way humanity viewed communication from an ideological perspective. Two of the main ways in which the telegraph changed ideology was through monopolistic capitalism. In other words, business was no longer done just face to face, but business deals and transactions could now be done across the country. Transportation was no longer a necessity in executing human interaction. Another interesting point was how the telegraph even affected religion. Being a religious person myself I find this particular topic very interesting. As the telegraph was created many traditional religious groups tried to either justify this miraculous creation, while others even claimed it was the work of the devil. The idea of an electronic, intangible form of communication was formerly believed to be a power reserved for celestial beings. This advancement most definitely changed the world and even my personal day to day life. Later findings such as the telephone, wireless telephones, computers and eventually the worldwide web, all pieced together the digital age of communication we are familiar with today.
     These readings were extremely informative, and brought to light a lot of ideas that I otherwise would have never stopped to recognize. The miracle of digital communication is often taken for granted, but the reality is that we live in a world that just over a century ago, people could have only dreamed of in another universe. The steady development and progress of technology is fascinating, and makes me wonder how different the world could look a century from now. Perhaps one day future generations will look back and think of our modern world as primitive.
